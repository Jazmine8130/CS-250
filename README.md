How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
We interpret user needs through conversations and asking probing questions. As well thinking about how i would like to interact with the program. 
Creating a user story helps the team to understand the full dynamics of what they user is wanting to do. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
We should always be approaching developing programs with an open mind and lots of questions to ensure comprehension. I plan to incorporate the feedback 
I receive in a way more towards agile and try to think of new developments this way too.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member respects the other team members. Respecting their time, workspace, and learning methods as well. As well having effective
communication amongst the whole team.
